\subsection{Parameter Choices}

Although $p$ can be arbitrary for our protocol, the implementation of the protocol benefits from some special forms of $p$. Choosing $p \equiv -1 \pmod 4$ means that $-1$ is not a square in $\F_{p^2}$ and hence $\F_{p^2} = \F_p(i)$ for $i^2 = -1$, which makes the arithmetic simpler.

In our implementation, we follow \cite{C:CosLonNae16} and choose
\begin{align*}
    p = 2^{372} \cdot 3^{239} - 1.
\end{align*}

\paragraph{TODO} Write something about the balance of $2^{372} \approx 3^{239}$.

\paragraph{TODO} Write something about the choice of the curve and etc.

\subsection{Implementation Details}

We use the GMP library \cite{Granlund12} as our high precision arithmetic library. Based on GMP library, we build up several C++ classes based on our purpose.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Integer class: we wrap the GMP library into the integer class, which is more convenient to use.
    \item Fp class: we implement the basic $\F_p$ field using Integer class as well as computing the square root of an element.
    \item Fp2 class: similar to $\F_p$, we implement the basic $\F_p$ field containing the square root algorithm.
    \item Curve class:
    \item RPoint class:
    \item Isogeny class:
    \item IsogenyChain class:
\end{itemize}
